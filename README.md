# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
We are trying to find some forms of correlation between the many crytocurrencies on the market. We had the computer classify and condense all the information we had available to us into numbers it could read. Once read, we were able to make a table to showcase crypto that is in demand and not in demand.

## Results


As seen in the table, we have been able to show how in demand a coin is based on the location. The closer it is to the center of 0, the more demand and less supply it has. The better we are to the 0 figure, the more risk we can take on trading as it is in demand.
